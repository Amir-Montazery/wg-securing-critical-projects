## Presentations ## 

The Securing Critical Projects working group encourages researchers, advocates, maintainers, and members of all backgrounds to present relevant material to the group. The working group meetings serve as a forum for presentations and associated discussion. While the working group makes an effort to upload presentations, not all can be feasibly displayed due to formatting issues. 

However, all presentations are accessible in the working group notes and can be found in the [Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MIXxadtWsaROpFcJnBtYnQPoyzTCIDhd0IGV8PIV0mQ/edit).
