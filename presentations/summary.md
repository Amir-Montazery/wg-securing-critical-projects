## Presentations ## 

The Securing Critical Projects working group encourages advocates, researchers, maintainers, and members of all backgrounds to present. The working group meetings serve as a forum for presentations and associated discussion. While the working group makes an effort to upload presentations, not all can be feasibly displayed due to formatting issues. 

However, all presentations are accessible in the working group notes and can be found in the [Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MIXxadtWsaROpFcJnBtYnQPoyzTCIDhd0IGV8PIV0mQ/edit).
