## Presentations ## 

The Securing Critical Projects working group encourages advocates, researchers, maintainers, and members of all backgrounds to present. The working group meetings serve as a forum for presentations and associated discussion. While the working group makes an effort to upload presentations, such as the "State of Linux Security", not all can be feasibly displayed due to formatting issues. 

However, all presentations are linked in the working group notes and can be accessed at [Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MIXxadtWsaROpFcJnBtYnQPoyzTCIDhd0IGV8PIV0mQ/edit).
