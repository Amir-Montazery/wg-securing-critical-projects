# Identifying Critical Projects

Here are various papers and programs that attempt to quantitatively identify the most critical open source software (OSS) projects.

* [*Vulnerabilities in the Core: Preliminary Report and Census II of Open Source Software*](https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/programs/census-program-ii/)
  by Frank Nagle, Jessica Wilkerson, James Dana, and Jennifer L. Hoffman, Linux Foundation & Harvard, February 2020.
* [Open Source Project Criticality Score program](https://github.com/ossf/criticality_score) - a program
  that scores a given OSS project using an algorithm described in
  ["Quantifying Criticality" by Rob Pike](https://github.com/ossf/criticality_score/blob/main/Quantifying_criticality_algorithm.pdf)
  (you can see the [Hacker News Discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25381397))
* [Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII) Open Source Software Census II Strategy](https://www.ida.org/research-and-publications/publications/all/c/co/core-infrastructure-initiative-cii-open-source-software-census-ii-strategy)
  by David A. Wheeler & Jason N. Dossett, October 2017
* [Open Source Software Projects Needing Security Investments](https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/04/pub_ida_lf_cii_070915.pdf)
  by David A. Wheeler & Samir Khakimov, June 19, 2015
* ["The Dark Reality of Open Source Through the Lens of Threat and Vulnerability Management" by Risksense](https://risksense.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/RiskSense-Spotlight-The-Dark-Reality-of-Open-Source.pdf), which identifies OSS with the most publicly-reported vulnerabilities reported as CVEs. Having more reported vulnerabilities does not mean that the software is necessarily more vulnerable; it often means that more people are looking for vulnerabilities & that there's a robust process for processing them. However, if so many people are searching for vulnerabilities in a product, that suggests it's an important (critical) project)
