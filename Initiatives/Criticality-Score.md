## Crticiality Score ##

The OpenSSF Criticality Score tool, maintainted by members of the Securing Critical Projects working group, utilizes a data-driven approach to accomplish the following goals:

1. Generate a criticality score for every open source project.

2. Create a list of critical projects that the open source community depends on.

3. Use this data to proactively improve the security posture of these critical projects.
