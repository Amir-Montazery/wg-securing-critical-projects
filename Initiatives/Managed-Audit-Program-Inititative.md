## Managed Audit Program Initiative ##

The OpenSSF, via the Securing Critical Projects working group, received a proposal from Open Source Technology Improvement Fund, Inc to fund a risk-based and data-driven audit program focused on securing critical open-source projects. 

The proposal consisted of an initial list of 25 Critical Open-Source Projects to be considered for the Managed Audit Program. The MAP 25 proposal and project list can be found [here](https://github.com/Amir-Montazery/OSTIF/blob/main/Managed-Audit-Program-Inititative-Proposal.md)
