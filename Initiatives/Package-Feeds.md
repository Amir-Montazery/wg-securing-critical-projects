## OSSF Package Feeds ##

OSSF Package Feeds is an initiative to aid in the analysis of open-source packages. The binary produced by cmd/scheduled-feed/main.go can be used to monitor various package repositories for changes and publish data to external services for further processing.

Additionally, the repo contains a few subprojects to aid in the analysis of these open source packages, in particular to look for malicious software.

The Package Feeds tool is available [here](https://github.com/ossf/package-feeds).
